        <h3>What is Computer?</h3>
        <p>
          A computer is a machine that can store and process information. Most
          computers rely on a binary system, which uses two variables, 0 and 1,
          to complete tasks such as storing data, calculating algorithms, and
          displaying information. Computers come in many different shapes and
          sizes, from handheld smartphones to supercomputers weighing more than
          300 tons.
        </p>
        <h3>who Invest The Computer</h3>
        <p>
          Many people throughout history are credited with developing early
          prototypes that led to the modern computer. During World War II,
          physicist John Mauchly, engineer J. Presper Eckert, Jr., and their
          colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania designed the first
          programmable general-purpose electronic digital computer, the
          Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC).
        </p>
        <h3>What is the most powerful computer in the world?</h3>
        <p>
          As of November 2021 the most powerful computer in the world is the
          Japanese supercomputer Fugaku, developed by RIKEN and Fujitsu. It has
          been used to model COVID-19 simulations.
        </p>
        <h3>How Do Program Language work?</h3>
        <p>
          Popular modern programming languages, such as JavaScript and Python,
          work through multiple forms of programming paradigms. Functional
          programming, which uses mathematical functions to give outputs based
          on data input, is one of the more common ways code is used to provide
          instructions for a computer.
